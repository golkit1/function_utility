# function_utility

Max for Live utiitiy device.
This device uses the function object to control multiple GUI objects.

You can choose up to 4 different function ('envelope') objects and for each one you can:
- Randomise the function with any selectable number of segments.
- Select between linear or curve mode (curve mode lets you curve the segments of the envelope using the alt key (mac).
- Choose for each envelope if to start and end at zero point or to be floating (anywhere between 0 and 1 of the Y axis).
- Map each envelope to any GUI object in Ableton (knobs, sliders, sends etc).
- Scale each mapped envelope using the min and max live number boxes
    
You can control all the mapped envelopes with the main kbob (Param).
    
You can save different presets on the device.
